# Browserist – Python Extension for Selenium 👨‍💻
## What is Browserist?
> ***browserist***
> *1. The belief that web browsers account for differences in websites or web applications in all of their ability and that a particular web browser is superior to others.*
> *2. Discrimination or prejudice based on web browser.*

Despite the [urban definition](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=browserist), Browserist is a Python extension of the [Selenium web driver](https://www.selenium.dev/) that makes it even easier to use different browsers for testing and automation.

## Key Features
With Browserist as an extension to Selenium, you get:

:white_check_mark: &nbsp;&nbsp;Improved stability and speed

:white_check_mark: &nbsp;&nbsp;Simple syntax and less code

:white_check_mark: &nbsp;&nbsp;Hassle-free setup across browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, Internet Explorer

:white_check_mark: &nbsp;&nbsp;Extensive framework of functions that makes browser automation easy

:white_check_mark: &nbsp;&nbsp;Efficient development workflow with IntelliSense and type hints

## Example
Imagine you want to fill out a form on a website. Here's how easy it is with Browserist: We open an automated browser session, access the website, fill out the form, and then submit it. The browser will hereafter close automatically:

```python linenums="1"
from browserist import Browser

with Browser() as browser:
    browser.open.url("https://example.com")

    browser.input.value("//xpath/to/name_field", "My Name")
    browser.input.value("//xpath/to/email_field", "contact@example.com")
    browser.input.value("//xpath/to/phone_field", "123-456-7890")
    browser.input.value("//xpath/to/address_field", "123 Main St, Anytown USA")

    browser.click.button("//xpath/to/submit_button")
```

If you're new to XPath — a powerful query language used to target elements of a web page — don't worry. You can find out more in the [XPath basics tutorial](xpath/basics.md).
