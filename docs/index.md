# Browserist – Python Extension for Selenium 👨‍💻
## What is Browserist?
> ***browserist***
> *1. The belief that web browsers account for differences in websites or web applications in all of their ability and that a particular web browser is superior to others.*
> *2. Discrimination or prejudice based on web browser.*
