# How to Install Edge and the Microsoft Edge WebDriver
## Install Microsoft Edge
Edge is a free, open-source web browser developed by Microsoft. Visit their website to find out more and [download the latest version of Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge).

## Install Microsoft Edge WebDriver
More info and download [here](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/).

## Troubleshooting and Tips
If you are planning to use different browsers, please refer to the [guide on options for browser types](../../settings/browser-types.md).

!!! tip
    Always keep your browser and driver up to date. The EdgeDriver version should usually match the browser version, otherwise Browserist might throw an error.

## How to Use Edge with Browserist
Once you have successfully installed the Edge browser and its WebDriver, you can start using them with Browserist. Here is an example of how to automate Edge using Browserist. Simply select Edge as the browser type in the `BrowserSettings` configuration:

```python linenums="1" hl_lines="3 5"
from browserist import Browser, BrowserSettings, BrowserType

settings = BrowserSettings(type=BrowserType.EDGE)

with Browser(settings) as browser:
    browser.open.url("https://example.com")
    browser.wait.seconds(5)
```
