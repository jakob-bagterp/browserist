# XPath Basics üîç
XPath is a query language that is used for traversing through not just an HTML document ‚Äì but also XML, XSLT and other document types. It is used commonly to search particular elements or attributes with matching patterns, and XPath includes over 200 built-in functions.

While we use XPath in context of HTML and Python, it's commonly used in other programming languages like JavaScript, Java, C#, C++, and many more.

## How It's Used in Browserist
XPath is an integral of Browserist to target elements of a web page. For example, we can easily get the text of the first `<h1>` headline element without knowinw its exact location on the page:

```python linenums="1"
text = browser.get.text("//h1[1]")
print(text)
```

Or we can easily input values in a form if we know the `id` attribute of the input field. Again, we don't want to know the exact location of the input field on the page:

```python linenums="1"
browser.input.value("//*[@id='username']", "John Doe")
browser.input.value("//*[@id='password']", "password123")
```
